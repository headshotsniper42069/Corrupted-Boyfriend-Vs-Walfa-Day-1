# Friday Night Funkin' - Touhou Echoes of Cyberscape Public Source Code

Currently, the whole mod was programmed by me, with a few expections being the stage Lua files and whatnot.

This mod uses Psych Engine, with a few quality of life features, like Exception Catching, and Native Cutscene Playback

(i just capitalized them cause it looked cool)

## Have fun!
