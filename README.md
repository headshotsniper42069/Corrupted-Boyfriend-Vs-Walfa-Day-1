# Friday Night Funkin' - Touhou Echoes of Cyberscape Public Source Code

Currently the whole mod was programmed by me, with a few expections being the stage Lua files and whatnot.

This mod uses Psych Engine, with a few quality of life features, like playing cutscenes in game without a lua file

There is also launch options added into the demos of the game that you can use with Command Prompt on Windows. They might not serve any purpose outside of testing, except for the second option.

| Launch Option | Effect |
| ------------- | ------ |
| --mainmenu | Replaces the main menu's code with the internal debugger, used for setting the position and scale for each character. Ignores any unlocking criterias, so it's up to you if you wanna complete the mod first |
| --skiptime | Adds the Skip Time function from charting mode into normal gameplay. This exists to save time with having to go to charting mode for skipping time, and so makes it avaliable without Charting Mode. |
| --shameisentlink | Sets the Ayaya status to "Sent Link". Normally gets set after the game throws the text file at you, which lets you play the song.|
| --shameicomplete | Sets the Ayaya status to "Complete". Normally gets set after you've beaten Ayaya, which let's you play the song from Freeplay, letting you also play it on the Lunatic difficulty. Also prevents you from playing the song while already in another song. |

To reset your status on Ayaya, hold down the "A" key in the main menu for 3 seconds.

## Have fun!
