# Friday Night Funkin' - Touhou Echoes of Cyberscape Public Source Code

**Check the commits if you want older versions of the mod**

Currently the whole mod was programmed by me, with a few expections being the stage Lua files and whatnot.

This mod uses Psych Engine, with a few quality of life features, like playing cutscenes in game without a Lua file.

There is also launch options added into the demos and the first version of the mod that you can use with Command Prompt on Windows. They might not serve any purpose outside of testing, except for the second option.

| Launch Option | Demo Effect | Version 1 Effect | Version 2 Effect |
| ------------- | ----------- | ---------------- | ---------------- |
| --mainmenu | Replaces the main menu's code with the internal debugger, used for setting the position and scale for each character. Ignores any unlocking criterias, so it's up to you if you wanna complete the mod first | Same effect, but character set is random | Does nothing. |
| --skiptime | Adds the Skip Time function from charting mode into normal gameplay. This exists to save time with having to go to charting mode for skipping time, and so makes it avaliable without Charting Mode. | Same effect | Same effect, although you lose the fancy pause screen |
| --shameisentlink | Sets the Ayaya status to "Sent Link". Normally gets set after the game throws the text file at you, which lets you play the song. | Ayaya can be played without having to get the text file thrown at you, so this isnt anything major | Same effect |
| --shameicomplete | Sets the Ayaya status to "Complete". Normally gets set after you've beaten Ayaya, which let's you play the song from Freeplay, letting you also play it on the Lunatic difficulty. Also prevents you from playing the song while already in another song. | Same effect | Same effect |

To reset your status on Ayaya, hold down the "A" key in the main menu for 3 seconds.

## Have fun!
